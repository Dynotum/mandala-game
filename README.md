## Synopsis

The mancala games are a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds
and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or
some set of the opponent's pieces.- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala)

### Built With

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

## Gameplay

> * The board is designed for two players. There are six pits on each player's side and a Mancala (large pit) on either
    > end.
>* To start place 6 stones in each pit, leaving the Mancalas empty.
>* Decide who goes first. (Randomly)
>* One player picks up all the stones in one of their own pits.
>* Starting with the next pit (counterclockwise), drop one stone in each pit including your own Mancala and skipping your
   > opponentâ€™s Mancala.
>* If the last stone is dropped in your own Mancala, you get to play again.
>* If the last stone is dropped in an empty pit on your own side and there are stones in the pit opposite the pit adhere
   > you just dropped the last stone, then you get to capture your own stone and all the stones in the opposite pit and
   > place this all in your own Mancala. Otherwise, it is the other players turn.
>* Then all the pits on one side are empty, the other player gets to take all the stones on their own side and place
   > those stones into their own Mancala.
>* At the end, whoever has the most stones in their Mancala wins.

   ```
* Install [OpenJDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/)
*
Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?fbclid=IwAR2AaWmjSE--7nfr9qgNqGt9Hit-Qt6VwNW2r8SYkUcz9GqfbExwb9qNy9s#installing-and-updating)

* npm v8.1.0
* Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)  1.22.17

> IMPORTANT : If you do not want to install nvm, NodeJS nor yarn, you can use Gradle to generate a JAR file with all the dependencies. Follow the instructions below.

## Generate a JAR

* If you do not want to install Node.js, nvm, neither Yarn nor you do have a different versions. You can follow these
  steps in order to generate a JAR and execute it.

> If you don't want to generate and run a JAR file and prefer to run it manually, go to the Backend section followed by the Frontend.

1. Clean with Gradle
   ```sh
   $ ./gradlew clean
   ```
2. Execute a task with Gradle in order to download all the dependencies under the project.
   ```sh
   $ ./gradlew executeYarn
   ```
3. Let's generate a JAR file.
   ```sh
   $ ./gradlew bootJar
   ```
4. We're ready to go, run the JAR file that has been created in order to start the app.
   ```sh
   $  java -jar build/libs/malanca-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
5. Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

## Backend

**Run Backend**

1. Clean and build with Gradle
   ```sh
   $ ./gradlew clean build
   ```
2. Run the backend project app on local with Gradle
   ```sh
   $ ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
   > It will be running at http://localhost:8080

3. (Optional) Generate and run jar file only for backend purposes
   ```sh
   $ ./gradlew bootJar
   ```
   > The jar is created under the $project/build/libs/ folder
   ```sh
   $ java -jar malanca-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

## Test

1. Execute bundle of unit and integration tests
   ```sh
   $ ./gradlew test
   ```

## Frontend

**Run Frontend**

1. First, check our version of Node after installing it with nvm If the installation was successful, you should be able
   to run the following command.
   ```sh
    $ node --version
    v16.13.0

    $ npm --version
    8.1.0   
   ```
2. Yarn installation
    * After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.
   ```sh
    $ npm install -g yarn   
   ```

3. In the fronted project directory (called frontend folder), you need to install all the dependencies listed within
   package.json in the local node_modules folder.
   ```sh
    $ yarn install   
   ```


4. In the fronted project directory (called frontend folder), you can start the application:
   ```sh
    $ yarn start   
   ```

> Runs the app in the development mode.

4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
